FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
==========================

1. How can I change the Safe Place destination ?
   Edit your HUD and go to "contents" tab.
   You will see a landmark named "safe_place".
   Delete it.
   Open your inventory and find the landmark of your choice.
   Drag and drop it into the "contents" of the HUD (i assume it is still
   in edit mode).
   Rename it to "safe_place"
   Close the edit mode, clicking on the 'x' on the top-right corner
   of the edit window
   There it is. Now "Safe Place" button will teleport you to your safe place

2. How much is it ?
    Its free. You can copy, transfer, modify and redistribute your 
    modifications if you want. 
    Free of charge and free as in freedom.

3. Why did you do this ?
    Because I believe SL should be a safe place for everyone.
    But, it seems that not everyone in SL thinks this way and some
    of them thinks that stalking others is OK. Its not! Not in RL, not in SL.

4. No... seriously... how much ?
    Seriously. Its free.
    If you feel very generous and really want to pay something, just send
    the amount you believe is fair to <mithos.anatra>
    If you think it would be useful for others, share it with them.
    
5. Why do you use the avatar's key and not the avatar's name ?
    Because names can be changed.
    Each object in SL has a unique key that identifies it to SL servers.
    It is the same for avatars. Each avatar in SL has its own key that is
    unique and immutable.
    If your stalker changes its name, the key will be the same and the 
    radar will identify it when it enters the region you are in and will tell 
    you the name its using now, so you can find the avatar (if you want)
    and don't get surprised.
    
6. Do you get the alts too ?
    Nope. Thats why the HUD stores a list of keys and not a single name
    or single key.
    So... as soon as you identify an alt of your stalker, you can add it to
    your stalkers list and will be warned of the presence of both.
