  More information on how to change it on F.A.Q.


- ON
  Turns the radar "on" 
  

- OFF
  Turns the radar "off"


- Advanced
  opens the "Advanced" dialog
  

- Add Av
  Adds a new avatar key to your stalker list.
  You must use the avatar's name, not the display name.
  If you don't know the difference, here's how you can get it:
  
  Open the avatar's profile.
  On "Name:" field, you will see the Display Name and the username. 
  It is, usually, in the form: Display Name (user.name)
  You have to use the user.name that is inside the (  ).


- Remove Av
  Removes an avatar from your stalkers list.
  It will ask you for a "index key".
  Don't worry. You can get this on the next button...
  
  
- List Av
  Will list the keys of the stalkers stored in your list and an index.
  The index (first number on the left) is the position of the key in the list.
  You can use this index to remove a key from the list.


- Advanced -> Key to Name
  If you have too much keys listed in your stalkers list (i hope you don't)
  and you want to delete some of them, for any reason, you can use
  this button to check the name associated with that key.


- Clear Av List
  Be careful. This button will clear your stalker list.
  Use with caution.
  It will ask you if you are sure of this action before clearing the list
  as a last resource of security, so you don't clear the list for mistake.
