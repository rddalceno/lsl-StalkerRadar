HOW TO USE THIS HUD

You will need 2 things:
1. Your stalkers key (I will tell you how to get it, don't worry)
2. A landmark for your safe place. If you don't have one, 
    there is one already inside the HUD that will teleport you 
    to the Safe HUB.

Step by Step

1.  Get the stalker's key
    Open your stalker's profile. The key is that weird number
     that appears under the avatar's name and is usually in 
     the form: 01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef

2.  Wear it or attach as a HUD.
    It should appear as your left-botton HUD

    As soon as you wear it (or attach), it starts to scan the region.

3.  After wearing it, edit it (right-click on it -> edit ).
    Go to the 'Content' tab and you will find a notecard called "avlist". 
    Double click on it so you can edit this notecard.
    
4. Add the stalker's key to the beggining of the line. If you
    have more than 1 key to scan, just separate them with comas
    like the example already in the notecard.
    
    key1, key2, key3, ...

** Important Note**
    The keys MUST be in the same line and they MUST be separated 
    by comas. If you put the key in a new line (pressing ENTER), the 
    HUD will not read it. It is a limitation of the Linden Scripting Language
    and it is very tricky to make it read several lines in an efficient way.
    
5. Add  your preferred safe place landmark and rename it to
   'safe_place'. You may have to delete the one already in the
   HUD's inventory before renaming yours.
   
6. Finish editing the HUD and it will restart the scan for the new keys

7. Touch the HUD to activate the dialog. 
    Using the dialog, you can turn it ON and OFF and to rapidly teleport
    to your safe place.

If you have any questions about this HUD, just IM me: mithos.anatra 

Everytime you change the contents of the avlist notecard or the 
landmark, the HUD will be turned ON, restarting the scan.

When you change between regions (when you teleport) it turns ON
again, restarting the scan.

All of these are safety measures so don't forget to enable the scanning 
by accident

The scan is made by the user's key because the name can be changed
but the key never changes so, this way, you will always be warned about 
the presence of the stalker in the same region as you.

Unfortunately, it's not possible to identify alt's of the same user. Thats why 
you can put more than 1 key in the notecard.

This is freesoftware, which means you can copy, modify and redistribute
as you wish. Just read the license in the scrip for more information.

If you feel this is useful and think it should be payed, send a tip
with the value you think it worth to: mithos.anatra .

My best wishes for you and I hope it helps you evade those stalkers.
